### Project Overview: Todo List Application

This project is a simple **Todo List application** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to help users track and manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application allows users to add, view, and filter tasks based on their status (active, completed, or all tasks). Additionally, the app provides real-time feedback on the completion progress of tasks.

#### Features:

1. **Add Tasks:** Users can input new tasks into a text field and click "Add Task" to append them to the task list.
2. **Task Filtering:** Tasks can be filtered by status—**All**, **Active**, or **Completed**—using the filter buttons provided. This allows users to easily manage and view tasks based on their progress.
3. **Progress Tracker:** A dynamic progress bar displays the percentage of completed tasks in real time, giving users a visual representation of their task completion rate.
4. **Responsive Design:** The app is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktops and mobile devices.
